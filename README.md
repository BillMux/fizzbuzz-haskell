# FizzBuzz Haskell

I have started to study a new language, Haskell, by test driving the programming classic FizzBuzz.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo

2. [Download Haskell Platform] (https://www.haskell.org/platform/) (if you haven't already)

3. Check you have the latest version of Haskell's packager Cabal: `cabal`
If you don't, this command should install and update straight away!

4. Install the testing framework, HSpec: `cabal install hspec`
