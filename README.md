# FizzBuzz Haskell

I have started to study a new language, Haskell, by test driving the programming classic FizzBuzz.
The module returns "Fizz" when a number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" when a number is divisible by 5, "FizzBuzz" when a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, and returns the original number otherwise

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo

2. Download Haskell Platform [https://www.haskell.org/platform/] (if you haven't already)

3. Check you have the latest version of Haskell's packager Cabal: `cabal`
If you don't, this command should install and update straight away!

4. Install the testing framework, HSpec: `cabal install hspec`

## Running the tests

`runhaskell FizzBuzzSpec.hs`
